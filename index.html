          <li>The head element contains information, or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>Elements within the haed are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element defines 3 elements:</li>
              <li>1.charset:sets character encoding</li>
              <li>2.http-equiv:sets a HTTP header</li>
              <li>3.viewport:sets default view for our webpage</li>  
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>All the elements we want the user to see and interact with are placed inside the body element.</li>
          <li>If there are 3 elements nested inside of the body element, those 3 nested elements are known as the child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the childern is known as the parent element</li>
          <li>This parent/child language is often used by developers to explain the relationship among elements in HTML.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage users.</li>
          <li>Metadata is typically not seen by users.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheet also known as CSS is a programing language used by developers to define how a webpage content is presented to a user.</li>
          <li>CSS defines color, aesthetics, visual layout, and organization</li>
          <li>It is used to define style rules for specific elements of an HTML page and format </li>
          <li>The 3 ways to style a webpage is; Inline CSS, Internal style sheet, and External style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when developers want to style an element directly in HTML files. Its applied to specific HTML tags. Useful for quick and permanent changes but less flexible than the other 2 styles.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage, in the head section of the HTML files. Those orules are only applied to that page, you can configure CSS classes and IDs which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in a page code.</li>
          <li>External style sheet is the most commonly used method. Its perferred due to the fact that developers can keep all their CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
        </ul>
